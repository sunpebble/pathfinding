# Specification Quality Checklist: Data Crawler & Training Dataset

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category               | Status | Notes                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Content Quality        | ✅ PASS | Spec focuses on WHAT/WHY, not HOW               |
| Requirement Completeness | ✅ PASS | All requirements testable, no clarifications needed |
| Feature Readiness      | ✅ PASS | Ready for planning phase                        |

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All assumptions documented in the Assumptions section
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
